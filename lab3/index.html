					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to create an introductory homepage for ourselves, manage our files more neatly, and to 
						become more familiar with uploading sites to the Github server.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We struggled with a variety of aspects within this lab, including uploading images, how to properly format the CSS code, and how exactly
						to upload our site from a local file to Github, even despite the Lab 3 instructions. It's remarkable this site exists alone. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We mutually found difficulty in completing this lab, however, faced the adversity together by meeting in person and problem solving. 
						In the end, we somehow found our way kind of, despite still having multiple questions and not exactly completing every aspect of the 
					assignment. </p>
