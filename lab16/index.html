			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON & APIs</h1>
			<div id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we had to use JSON with APIs.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My usual partner went a little AWOL mode regarding this lab and due to this, I had to outsource help so shoutout to
						Franchesca B for helping me in my time of need.
			</div>

			<div id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was stressful since my partner went into the void and I had to rely on a seperate person to help me. However, they
						explained through Discord what I was messing up on (which was quite a lot).
