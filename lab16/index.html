			<div id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we had to use JSON with APIs with our partners.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Franchesca B helped me tremendously with this lab as I was very lost why my image was dedicated to not 
						showing up for me. I realized I made a mistake with the HTML code since I had the incorrect links for things.

			<div id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was stressful since I had no idea where I was going wrong, but after reaching out for help on Discord,
						it ended up working out.
