					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I found myself struggling since I have been having a hard time following the zoom lectures and required assistance from other
						classmates besides my partner since we were both lost. I wasn't getting the output after submitting the numbers and it took 
						a couple of tries before I finally got it working.
