					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, me and my partner worked with anon functions and callbacks in the console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I realized the function I made was kind of weird since I was using one from class but it worked out in the end.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment wasn't too hard and progressively made more sense as I worked on it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results are in my console.</p>
